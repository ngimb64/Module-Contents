## Prereqs
> To make sure this program runs as designed Python 3.8 should be installed. 
> Any missing modules have to be installed with PIP before the program can run. 
> I recommend simply googling the module name and finding the documentation. 
> The PIP command for installation is usually one of the first things mentioned.
> Also with Python it is common to have multiple modules with a similar names.
> So if errors are being raised about not having a certain module, it is
> most likely the wrong module with a similar name to the one that is required
> was installed instead of the required module.

## Installation
- Google Python downloads and install version 3.8.
- Make sure the associated modules are installed.
- Open up a command prompt and run the program.
- Change to the directory the program is placed and run it.

## Purpose
> This is a simple tool for prompting the user for a module to load, which it then
> runs the dir command to list all the available functions in the module.
> Finally it takes the ugly result (a big blog of mashed json) to a clean formated list,
> to then prompt the user if they want to save the list to file.
> I find this program useful for finding what functions are available in a clean list,
> easy to read and readily available for future reference.
